        //             - First character must be a lowercase letter
        //             - Last character must be a number
        //             - Password cannot contain spaces

        /*
            We solved this question in day17, but for more professional coding in Java,
            we will make two improvements:
            1-
            The inside of the while loop's parentheses runs as long as it is true.
            In this question, the variable "result" also contains a boolean value,
            but in terms of the logic of the question,
            the loop should run as long as "result" is false.
            2-
            Every time the while loop runs,
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            String password = scanner.nextLine();
            runs and a new object is created.
            The better way is to create the object before the loop
            and only assign a value inside the loop.
